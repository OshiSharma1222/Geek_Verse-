🌍 GIS-Based Coastal Resilience Platform
An integrated web application that identifies erosion-prone areas, monitors shelterbelt plantations, performs carbon accounting, and enables community engagement for conservation using GIS, remote sensing, AI, and blockchain technologies.

🚀 Project Overview
Coastal regions are increasingly vulnerable to erosion and climate change. This project builds a tech-driven solution that:

📍 Identifies erosion-prone zones using satellite data and AI models.

🌳 Monitors shelterbelt plantation density and health over time.

♻️ Calculates carbon sequestration for environmental impact tracking.

🛡️ Ensures secure and transparent data management via blockchain.

🤝 Engages local communities through interactive dashboards and conservation challenges.
